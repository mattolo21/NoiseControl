# NoiseControl
Noise control for open offices - implementation on Arduino Uno

The open office is the most popular workplace layout of the 21st century, but it has a dark side: the overall noise tends to drag down morale and makes people less productive.
In this context, the aim of this project is the creation of a prototype of a Noise Control system, based on the Arduino Uno platform, including both the hardware and software development.
The system will monitor the noise level through a microphone and, if the noise reaches a threshold level, it will emit a notification sound through a speaker.
The system will continue to emit the alert sound at a frequency depending on the input noise level, until it returns lower than the threshold level.
